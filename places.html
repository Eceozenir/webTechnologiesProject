    <p>Evliya Çelebi writes that the Maiden's Tower is a quadrangular castle with a height of 80 cubits (approximately 5.5 m.) and its surroundings are 200 steps. It has a guard, 100 guards, an arsenal and cannons, and an iron gate overlooking both sides of the tower. According to the author, the tower is an arrow's range away from the coast. Despite this statement by Evliya Çelebi, the tower was built in the 17th century. We learn from the western travelers who came to Istanbul in the same century that it lost its importance and ceased to be an element of defense in the middle of the century. Du Loir, one of these writers, says that no one was sitting in the Maiden's Tower except a man with his wife and that there were 4-5 cannons on the ground. Fr. Gemelli writes that he "did not see anything remarkable" inside the tower and that there were eight cannons there. Tavernier said; "Some cannons were placed on the shore of the tower, with which the Bosphorus can be preserved better than those in Sarayburnu. However, most of these cannons are neglected and useless," he says.
